GPS Pay – Seamless Payments & Smart Location Services via GPS
GPS Pay is an innovative Android application that leverages GPS technology to facilitate contactless payments and provide real-time location-based information. Designed for cafes, restaurants, toll booths, and various businesses, it eliminates the need for QR codes, FASTag, or cash, ensuring a swift and hassle-free user experience.​
